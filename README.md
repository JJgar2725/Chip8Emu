# Chip8Emu - a Chip8 emulator in C++

Hello! Welcome to ***Chip8Emu***!

This project orginated from wanting to experience making something on the lower side of programming, while still keeping it interesting and fun to learn something new.
That being said, the idea of Chip8Emu came to fruition, and development in C++ was chosen as the best option, mainly due to it being a major language used in coursework.
Using new libraries, such as the *cstdint* library, this allowed us to get started in creating the specifications of the Chip8 emulator (or interpretor), and moving on from there.
The project is mainly being developed in the **Visual Studio IDE**.

A general outline that we followed during the development process could be seen below!

...coming soon...
